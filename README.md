# Challenge5 Password Generator

Description

The aim of this challenge was to create an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript. 

Using the starter code I created an app that generates a password when the button is clicked and present a series of prompts for password criteria e.g. length of password and character types. Code validates each input and ensures at least one character is selected. Once all prompts are answered, the password is generated and displayed and written to the page.

This challenge helped me learn about and how to use intermediate javascript code.

The finer details of what I have learnt include:-
<ul>
 <li> Creating and using objects </li>
  <li>Creating and using functions </li>
  <li> Creating for loops </li>
  <li> Creating if statements </li>
  <li> Creating and using alert, prompt and confirm code </li>
  <li> Presenting the data in a user friendly format on the interface</li>

Technologies used:- MAC Terminal, VS Code and Git Hub.
